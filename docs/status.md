# Current milestone

M2

## Next actions

- Map out the pgAdmin-like metadata browsing experience and lock the UI spec for schemas/tables/columns/preview
- Add metadata-fetch APIs to the `db` module and call them asynchronously from the UI
- Research secure password storage options (OS keychain or master password) and decide the M2 implementation approach

## Notes

- M1 DoD is already met (connect / run SQL / show results and errors)
- In M2 we focus on metadata browsing and secure credential management when breaking down tasks
